# Darkest Mode

Darkest Mode is a collaboration between [Owen Corrigan](https://github.com/ojcorrigan) and [Zan Clifton](https://github.com/ZanClifton).

Having met on the [Northcoders Coding Boot Camp](https://northcoders.com/our-courses/coding-bootcamp) and paired for a sprint creating a browser game using React, Owen and Zan were particularly keen on the suggestion that they should look at [Universal Paperclips](https://www.decisionproblem.com/paperclips/) for inspiration, and planned an app that would take months to build, not the 2 days available to them at the time. Confident that the project was worth pursuing past this deadline, they've returned to continue building it.

Formerly an adult skills teacher and permaculture designer, Zan is also the National Chair of the Northern Independence Party.

Her interest in permaculture systems aligns well with good practice and effective design in software development, and this largely influenced her decision to become a developer.

As well as politics, permaculture, education and the environment, Zan is passionate about music and plays the trumpet, piano, steel drums, and the ukulele. She loves the Dungeons & Dragons tabletop RPGs, and one day, it is said, the Elder Scrolls series of games will need to be prised from her cold, dead hands.
